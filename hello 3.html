Linux working knowledge. 10. Operating Systems concepts, 11. OpenCV.Not only is the archaic distinction between first world and third world problematic, but I first took issue with the phrase when I was reading a blog post by an American transgender person documenting the gender dystopia they experienced growing up. A commenter posted “first world problems” in response. This implied that people living in developing countries do not experience gender dystopia or any other social issue that has nothing to do with disease and war. This phrase is a part of a larger depiction that dehumanizes residents of developing countries. It seems that it is easier to objectify them as malaria-infected, barely dressed figures that are perfect for the cover of National Geographic, than to see them as human beings who suffer depression, struggle with their sexual orientation or worry if their outfit is stylish enough. This reminds me of the video of CNN’s Soledad O’Brian challenging Tea Party leader Amy Kremer after she tweeted that President Barack Obama didn’t love America as much as Mitt Romney. Dog whistling aside, Kremer used Obama’s stance on foreign policy as her defense, saying that he was moving America from its rightful place as a city on a hill. </p> <hr>
