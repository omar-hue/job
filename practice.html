<p align="justify">There are 21,270 km of roads, ten per cent paved; these roads are vulnerable to damage by storms or floods, and have many bridges. The 4.8 km Jamuna multipurpose bridge was inaugurated in 1998, linking the east and the west of the country by road and railway.</p>

<p align="justify">A rail network of some 2,835 km links the main towns. The Dhaka–Chittagong line has frequent daily services. Rail is broad gauge in the west, narrow gauge in the east, with ferry links across rivers.</p>

<p align="justify">Bangladesh has 5–8,000 km of navigable waterway, depending on extent of flooding, and a well-developed water transport network, carrying more than 30 per cent of domestic freight. The main ports are Chittagong and Mongla, Chittagong dealing with the bulk of foreign trade. Shahjalal (formerly Zia) International Airport is 19 km north of Dhaka.</p>
